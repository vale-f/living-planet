The index represents 2,449 populations of 935 freshwater and terrestrial species. All indices are weighted by species richness, giving species-rich taxonomic groups in terrestrial and freshwater systems more weight than groups with fewer species. Index values are smoothed using a 3-year running average but keeping the first and final index values fixed."
